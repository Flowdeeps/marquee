# Marquee v1.0

You have no idea how surprised I am that <marquee> is still supported. I was ready to write a JS and CSS wrapper to reintroduce the tag but upon opening my dev browsers there it was, scrolling away happily. I guess that's saved me a day of codingâ€¦

## Set Up Dev Environment

$npm install

$bower install

$grunt build

$grunt watch

I use python's SimpleHTTPServer for most front-end projects which you can use by navigating to the folder holding your index and typing:

$python -m SimpleHTTPServer
